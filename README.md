# Phase 3 Project

- This program gives you the ability to create whatever book and author you want and store it in the database for later use. You will be able to list all of each and be able to delete and create more as you see fit.



# Requirments
- you will need python
- I used python verion 3.8.13 for this.


# The CLI in this program first imports all the things I need from helper.py so that I can use them when calling each function.

# I then have the main function which does all the calling of each function. Bellow that is just the menu so that the user can see the options of what you are able to do in this program.
